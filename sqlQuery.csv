I have secured a tee time for Saturday at 9:52 am for the New Course.  If I hear from Steve or Tom that they have a tee time already I will email you.  So check your email tomorrow and I will confirm the time or call me tomorrow evening if that is more convenient.  I look forward to playing given the mastery of the game I exhibited over the final 9 holes last week.

Joe,
Lets not forget that we had measure problems due to failing MS3 relay in the 
SEG converter, which caused the crow bar to engage, which in turn forced CB1 
to fault.
CB1 is designed to do both synchronization and was set to protect the turbine 
and the converter in a fault condition. The original instantaneous settings 
of 8000A was too high and allowed too much current through the system that 
damaged the converter and caused IGBTs to blow before it tripped. The second 
failure was due to a QA issue with failing CB1 to trip when it was commanded 
to by the converter. In both events we had catastrophic failures and lost 2 
converters due to CB1 failing to protect the system. To remedy this problem, 
we installed the PMT for CB1 redundancy and decreased the instantaneous 
setting from 8000A to 3000A and since then we didn''t have any IGBT blow ups 
or any catastrophic failures
Even though that I am still not clear about Gary''s question at the end, I 
hope that the above provide some help.

Thank you,

Joe Thorpe

Subject: Zilkha Availability
Kurt,
 Per our phone conversation, Mark Fisher and myself have been discussing 
availability with Gary from Zilkha. A question arose regarding the many 
operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place 
December through March. Gary''s thought is that when we recalculate the 
availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to 
Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not 
meet "(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the 
Technical Specifications", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an 
engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March 
to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many 
grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary 
brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG 
Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR 
were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while 
the grid was within Technical Specifications.', 'normal', '2015-7-15 17:45:45', '2015-7-16 57:40:10', 12, '0');

INSERT INTO `messages` VALUES(23, 2, 'Kirk Thunderwood', 'Susan Young', 'Toll Model Review Meeting Updates', '
The model review meeting on Thursday went well, and the consensus was that =
there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model. =
Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant co=
mpanies. Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An=
dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele=
ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners'' review. Withdrawn partner=
s agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11=
/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was=
 scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will=
 be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN=
GTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills'' cash flow=
 and COS model and prepare comments.

Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM=
Btu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, =
and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a=
ll the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussio=
n points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp=
act on the toll.

1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has=
 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5=
% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% f=
or Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews=
 need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any op=
inion on this, Bryan?

2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati=
on) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be=
 underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w=
ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed =
by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No=
rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer=
ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Fo=
othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis=
ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca=
sh flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service =
model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr=
ying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about le=
velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat=
er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correc=
t me if I am wrong here, Tim.

3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo=
w (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total =
Capex).

4) The Withdrawn Partners'' historical contributions ($228 million) will be =
added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee=
 of $40 million should be included in the project budget.

5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (1=
4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but=
 some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pac=
k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l=
east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year=
s.

6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin=
g 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdo=
wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin=
g, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financ=
ial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to c=
alculate AFUDC more accurately.

7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba=
lloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will=
 be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b=
e unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches=
 with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=20

8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t=
he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope=
rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currenc=
y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.

9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con=
struction period should be added.

Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c=
urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi=
ng IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la=
rger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan''s email. =20

This is contrary to the mandate of EnronOnline, which is to make global 
products trading available to our customers.
If there is a specific reason for shutting down a company, then we must do so 
- but we cannot restrict companies from trading products simply because we 
don''t think they want to.
How about this as an alternative:
1) Define the rules which are applied to restrict companies for trading (e.g. 
Must have a Power license to trade Power)
2) Distribute the appropriate rules and company lists between the NA primary 
legal contact and UK primary legal contact (for profile purposes)
3) Each legal group (NA and UK) apply each others rules to the companies 
which they are reviewing
4) Each legal group copies the other with the final company profile which 
they are sending to Frank Davis.

In this way, profiles should be correct as they leave each legal group, but 
each group has the opportunity to scan the work of the other. If there are 
any problems, then the customer profiles can be corrected - if necessary 
after the fact.
This exposes us to (in my opinion) a very small risk that:
 1) The rules for one group are not correctly applied by the other or there 
are extenuating circumstances for a particular party and
 2) The error is not caught before the customer transacts (bear in mind that 
after legal completes their review, there is still a great deal of time 
before the customer can transact, on account of: profile completion process, 
mailing time, customer delay before trading)

There are 1998 costs of $.6MM left in the old PROS J-work order.  These costs can be capitalized, but were not included in the project economics.  Per discussions with Rod, we will set up a separate S-work order to move these costs into, close out the J-w/o, and add a separate line item in the 2nd Capital Current Estimate.  At year end, we will add these costs to the project.  They will not affect the project economics, and there is no cash impact as they were spent in 1998.  No additional approvals will be required for this amount, but these costs will come out of the discretionary pool of capital dollars because they were never charged against capital spending when paid.

To summarize Bob''s note on the business analysis work order, of the $.8MM costs thru July, $.6MM can be capitalized assuming the project goes forward. The other $.2MM and future preliminary / pre coding costs need to be expensed. The recent SOP98-1, effective 12/15/98, has tightened up the capital / expense rulings on systems projects.

Corporate greed isn''t to blame for energy crisis in California
JERRY TAYLOR, PETER VANDOREN
04/01/2001
Houston Chronicle
4 STAR

(Copyright 2001)
TO hear California''s politicians tell it, heartless power- generating firms 
are the cause of the high price of West Coast electricity. 
Deregulation, the populists claim, allowed them to sell electricity at 
astronomical prices in an utterly dysfunctional wholesale market. The Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has now joined the witch hunt, ordering power 
generators to refund the state of California $124 million for "overcharges" 
during the power emergencies in January and February. The only problem with 
price controls, we''re told, is that they''re not more aggressively applied.
Have we learned nothing from economic history? 
The commission maintains that it cost 27 cents on average to produce a 
kilowatt hour of electricity during peak demand periods last January. 
California regulators, however, report that they paid an average of 28 cents 
for that power on the daily spot market. During February, wholesale natural 
gas prices exploded, resulting in production costs of 43 cents per kilowatt 
hour. Unfortunately, no published data exist to discern what that power 
actually sold for. But given the size of the commission-ordered rebates and 
the extent of the markups observed in previous months, it''s unlikely that 
wholesale prices were more than a few cents higher on average than production 
costs. Nonetheless, because the commission''s mission is to prohibit "unjust 
and unreasonable" wholesale prices, the commission wants the generators to 
give back the difference charged during the power emergencies earlier this 
year. 
The economic populists have seized on those commission orders as proof that 
they''re being robbed blind. But hold on a minute: The commission''s data 
clearly show that high wholesale electricity prices (which hovered around 3 
cents per kilowatt hour before the crisis hit last year) are primarily the 
result of higher production costs, not corporate greed. To be sure, industry 
analysts believe that actual production costs during power emergencies are 
far higher than the commission believes, but at least the commission has 
recognized that input prices explain most of the spike. The upshot is that 
higher production costs would have sent wholesale electricity prices through 
the roof even if the Legislature had not "deregulated" its electricity market 
in 1996. 
The commission also implicitly concedes - rightly - that the highest cost 
source of supply needed to meet demand is the legitimate price for all power 
sold in the state. For instance, the cost of producing a kilowatt hour of 
nuclear, coal, or renewable-fired electricity ranges from 2 cents to 6 cents, 
but the commission does not propose to require those generators to price at 
cost. 
Given the overall shortage of electricity in the Western region, the 
commission grants those power generators the right to charge what the market 
will bear. 
But wait: Why is it OK with the commission if some generators charge what the 
market will bear, but not OK for other generators to do likewise? Top 
electricity economists spanning the ideological spectrum agree that power 
supplies are so tight in the West that most natural gas-fired generators can 
charge more than their costs and still find willing buyers. Not only is this 
not a crime were it to occur in any other market, it''s necessary if 
electricity is to be allocated to those who need it the most. 
For the sake of argument, let''s assume that about a nickel out of each 
kilowatt hour sold during the peak demand periods in January represents 
"profiteering." If so, don''t blame the free market . . . it doesn''t exist. In 
California, generators can charge whatever they want during a crisis without 
fear that the prices they name will reduce sales because the state insists 
upon maintaining retail price controls. This is called a "dream scenario." 
Without those rate caps, generators would find that high prices reduce sales, 
providing a disincentive against charging the moon. The upshot is that retail 
price controls are themselves primarily responsible for whatever mischief 
exists. 
Still, we''re arguing about a nickel out of a bill of 28-45 cents per kilowatt 
hour. That''s a lot of to-do about relatively nothing. Drum all those alleged 
excess profits out of the market and we''re still in a world in which 
California ratepayers are getting one heck of a free ride. Even with the 40 
percent rate hike passed last week, California ratepayers are still paying 
only one-third to one-fifth the cost of the power they are consuming. 
You don''t need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that subsidies like that 
will inevitably result in excessive consumption, scarcity and blackouts. 
Those who think that denying the laws of supply and demand are the best way 
out of this mess will soon be pondering such thoughts in the dark.

Report: Potential rate hike included in California power talks
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The state''s negotiations to buy power lines from ailing 
Southern California Edison included a draft proposal that could mean another 
rate hike for customers, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. 
The newspaper said it obtained a 40-page draft memorandum of understanding, 
dated last week, that among other things could obligate Edison customers to 
help pay the utility''s massive debt through a "dedicated rate component" -- 
potentially a rate hike -- even if no power line deal is reached. 
The component, which wasn''t specified, wouldn''t show up in bills for two 
years, according to the draft. 
The document was dated Tuesday -- the same day that the state Public 
Utilities Commission approved record rate increases of up to 42 percent for 
Edison and 46 percent for PG&E. 
The PUC was scheduled to meet Monday to determine how best to hear from as 
many different groups as possible before implementing the increase. 
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said Sunday that the draft memorandum -- one 
of several floated in the state''s ongoing, nearly two-month-old talks with 
Edison -- already is obsolete. 
"This draft is ancient history," Steve Maviglio said. "We have moved beyond 
that, and continue to make progress and hope to be able to make an 
announcement shortly." He did not provide other details. 
On Friday, Edison officials described as "very active" talks with the 
governor''s office over the sale of its transmission lines to give the 
struggling utility a cash infusion. But SCE chief financial officer Ted 
Craver said a deal was not imminent. 
In addition to Edison, Davis wants to buy electrical lines from Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. for a combined total of about 
$7 billion. 
Edison and PG&E say they''ve lost nearly $14 billion since June to high 
wholesale prices. 
Talks between the state and PG&E are awaiting the outcome of the Edison deal, 
PG&E spokesman John Nelson said Sunday. 
Meanwhile, the Bush administration on Sunday reiterated its opposition to 
price controls as a method of halting soaring energy costs, including 
California''s. 
"Our view is that price caps on energy create shortages. They created the gas 
lines of the 1970s," U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said on ABC''s 
"This Week." 
"If we did them in California, for instance, where this call has gone out, 
we''d have more blackouts this summer, they''d last longer, and they''d go on 
into the future," Abraham said. 
As for helping the state, "we''re doing the most that we can," Abraham said. 
"But as I''ve said, we don''t have a generator in the basement of the 
Department of Energy where I can automatically send electricity, whether it''s 
to California or another part of the country."

Davis softens on rate hikes; Democrats fear backlash 

By John Marelius?
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April 1, 2001 
ANAHEIM -- Gov. Gray Davis all but abandoned his once-adamant opposition to 
electricity rate increases yesterday as angst over the potential political 
fallout from the energy crisis dominated what had been planned as a weekend 
of celebrating Democratic electoral gains in California. 
In a speech to the California Democratic Party Convention, the governor 
sketched the outlines of an alternative he is expected to propose to the rate 
increases of up to 46 percent approved last week by the state Public 
Utilities Commission. 
"If a rate increase becomes absolutely necessary to keep our lights on and 
keep our economy strong, you can be sure of one thing from this governor: 
I''ll fight to protect those least able to pay, reward those who conserve the 
most and motivate those who are the biggest guzzlers to cut back," Davis 
said. 

Some question value of transmission lines 
? 
Meanwhile, state Controller Kathleen Connell pointedly decried a "delaying 
and incremental" approach to the energy crisis and warned of a voter backlash 
against Democrats in next year''s elections. 
"Just ask President Jimmy Carter what happens when you stall and you don''t 
solve the gas-line problem," Connell said. "We don''t want to have that happen 
to California Democrats." 
Davis, who has a history of animosity with Connell, shrugged off the unstated 
but obvious critique of his handling of the crisis. 
"Everyone''s entitled to their point of view, but I believe that we''ve moved 
at warp speed to address this problem," he said. "I''m pleased that we''ve been 
able to keep the lights on most days. .?.?. Maybe if she''s not happy with 
that, she can run for governor next time." 
One analyst speculated that may be exactly what Connell has in mind. She is 
running for mayor of Los Angeles but is not expected to be a major factor, 
and term limits prevent her from seeking a third term as controller next 
year. 
"It''s the opening salvo in the 2002 Democratic primary campaign," said Sherry 
Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern 
California. "I don''t know how else to interpret it." 
With the election of President Bush and Republicans in control of Congress, 
the Democratic Party finds itself in its weakest position nationally since 
the Eisenhower administration. Yet in California, Democrats are in their 
strongest position in decades as they hold all but one statewide office and 
wide majorities in the state congressional delegation and both houses of the 
Legislature. 
A succession of convention speakers -- U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, House 
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Democratic National Committee 
Chairman Terry McAuliffe -- excoriated Bush''s assault on Democratic 
environmental and worker safety regulations and held up the California 
Democratic Party as a national model for Democratic electoral success. 
"If every Democratic Party in the country did what California did for House 
Democrats, I would have the (House speaker''s) gavel today," Gephardt said. 
For the first time, Democrats are holding their state convention in Orange 
County, a Republican stronghold where Democrats have been making solid 
inroads because of the steady influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin 
America. 
"This ain''t your grandfather''s Orange County," Davis crowed. "You know, 
Orange County has a Republican past, but it has a Democratic future." 
Such self-congratulation was tempered by the awareness that because Democrats 
hold such a position of dominance in California, voters will expect them to 
solve the electricity problem even as Democrats continue to blame it on the 
deregulation policies of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 
"There will be no excuses for Democrats in this state because we dominate 
state government," Connell said. 
She warned that continued "finger-pointing" would not solve the problem. 
Other speakers continued to hammer away at Wilson as some of the walls in the 
Anaheim Convention Center bore posters reading, "Wilson did it." And then 
there was the message inside the fortune cookies: "Energy fiasco. DNA proves 
Wilson at crime scene." 
"What the voters have to understand is that we inherited this crisis," said 
California Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres, who was elected to a second 
four-year term yesterday. "Now we''ve got to deal with it, and we should be 
held accountable on how we deal with it." 
Davis remains a strong favorite to win re-election next year, but his 
once-robust popularity apparently has taken a major hit in recent weeks, 
especially when blackouts began rolling across the state. 
"There are people polling and they show enormous deterioration in Davis'' 
numbers, and it looks like he''s got some real political problems," said 
Democratic strategist Bill Carrick. "But ultimately, he''s going to be judged 
on how he manages the crisis and can he get a solution on this before next 
year that makes some sense to people." 
For months Davis said electricity rate increases were out of the question and 
recently claimed he could have solved the problem in 20 minutes if he had 
been willing to entertain them. 
When the PUC voted its increase for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern 
California Edison Co. on Tuesday, Davis called the action premature, but did 
not offer an alternative. Yesterday, he said he was consulting with financial 
analysts and would propose a rate plan before the end of the 30-day period 
before the action of the independent commission becomes final. 
"I will have a fuller statement within the next two weeks, at which time I 
will speak to what if any rate hike I think is appropriate and how tiered 
pricing should be implemented," the governor said. 
Davis lashed back at Republican legislators who have escalated their 
criticism of his handling of the crisis. He blamed the GOP for the ill-fated 
1996 deregulation without mentioning that the plan cleared the Legislature 
with unanimous Democratic support. 
"The Republicans who were so enamored with deregulation just five years ago 
have become even more enamored with criticizing me as I try to clean up their 
mess," Davis said. "May I remind our Republican friends that this 
deregulation disaster was authored by a Republican legislator, passed by a 
Republican Assembly, signed into law by a Republican governor and implemented 
with undue haste by a Republican PUC."

Some question value of transmission lines 

By Jeff McDonald?
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
April 1, 2001 
Transmission lines have been upgraded. Poles are taller and sturdier. 
Electricity is shuttled farther and faster than ever before. 
But like internal combustion engines or indoor plumbing, not much has changed 
over the past 100 years in the fundamental design of the distribution network 
that pushes power across North America. 
The electric grid, a vast collection of wires and switches, has served 
millions of homes and businesses since the late 19th century. The grid has 
been expanded again and again, decade after decade. 
Now, with Gov. Gray Davis negotiating to buy huge sections of the grid owned 
by three cash-hungry California utilities, questions are being raised about 
the long-term value of such a dated delivery system. 
Is the web of power lines a key link in the supply chain whose worth will 
climb higher and higher as demand for electricity grows? Or will looming 
technology render the grid obsolete even before the state can pay off the 
bonds it issues to buy the system? 
"The usefulness of the grid is still intact -- it does work," said Mark 
McLaughlin, a researcher with the Alternative Energy Institute, a Tahoe 
City-based group that promotes renewable power sources. 
But "it will become less important over time -- 10, 15 years," he said. "As 
for being completely reliant on it, that is changing now and will continue to 
change at an ever-increasing pace." 
Technological advances already are redefining traditional electricity 
delivery. 
With blackouts crippling businesses across the state -- and additional 
outages forecast for this summer -- more and more companies are investing in 
so-called distributed generation, a broad term applied to any number of 
devices that can make power on-site. 
Increasingly popular products such as microturbines, cogeneration plants, 
photovoltaic systems and residential fuel cells allow consumers to limit 
their reliance on utility companies such as San Diego Gas and Electric. 
"This (power) crisis has generated a huge amount of interest in the product," 
said Mark Kuntz of Capstone, a San Fernando Valley-based company that markets 
30-and 60-kilowatt microturbines. 
"We''re in the process of responding to that interest and turning it into 
orders." 
The abundance of alternatives for businesses and homeowners has propelled a 
new debate: what to do with the surplus power produced by distributed 
generation systems. 
Investors are banking that the electric grid will remain hugely valuable 
because it can move energy in any direction. 
"We are building a company around our bullishness on the grid," said Fred 
Buckman, chairman of Trans-Elect Inc., a private Washington, D.C.-based 
company that plans to spend $15 billion acquiring transmission lines. 
"The deployment of smaller distributed generation systems will reduce the 
rate at which we have to grow the transmission system, but we don''t believe 
it will replace the grid." 
Trans-Elect bid up to $5 billion for the lines owned by Southern California 
Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and SDG&E. But that offer was pushed aside 
by utility company executives when it became clear that Davis wanted the grid 
for the state of California. 
More important to utilities, however, may be the eventual sales price. 
Edison agreed in principle to sell its share of transmission lines to the 
state for $2.76 billion. But details of that proposed deal -- announced in 
February -- remain to be worked out. 
In the meantime, lawmakers are growing anxious about continuing delays. Some 
legislators say Davis should rethink buying the grid and instead consider 
acquiring the utilities'' hydroelectric networks. 
The $2.76 billion price tag for the Edison lines is about 2.3 times the their 
book value -- the base worth used by regulators to set rates of return. 
If PG&E and SDG&E reach similar deals with the governor, the cost of 
acquiring some 32,000 miles of transmission lines could reach $7.4 billion -- 
too much, some consumer advocates worry, to make the transaction a good deal 
for ratepayers. 
Public ownership of the grid would give the state a powerful hand in dealing 
with federal energy regulators, who so far have refused to rein in power 
generators, consumer groups say. 
The acquisition also would curtail unnecessary additions to the system, 
investments that provide guaranteed profits to the current owners, activists 
say. 
"The state isn''t looking to make money expanding the system," said Michael 
Shames of the Utility Consumers'' Action Network. "The state can establish a 
policy that says no new grid will be built where distributed generation can 
substitute." 
But many experts believe that even as microturbines, fuel cells, windmills, 
solar power and more cogeneration plants take root in coming years, the grid 
will be needed to deliver surplus power to other places that can use it. 
Without having ways to move power from place to place, a major benefit of 
distributed generation would fall by the wayside. 
"The only way small assets are useful is if they can be shared when some 
power isn''t needed, and you can''t do that without a grid," said Mark P. 
Mills, an energy consultant and co-editor of the Digital Power Report. 
"The grid becomes more important the more you distribute things." 
Nancy Floyd is a co-founder of Nth Power, a San Francisco venture capital 
group that seeks investment opportunities in utility innovations -- 
particularly the transmission and distribution of electricity. 
Five years ago, the firm had $50 million to spend. By 1999, the investment 
pool had climbed to $350 million. Last year, the company portfolio soared to 
$1 billion. 
"This is an area that''s attracting a lot of capital, which means you''re going 
to have a steady stream of new products and services," Floyd said. "That is 
the bright side of deregulation." 
Pure Energy Corp. of Syracuse, N.Y., has operated the Iceoplex cogeneration 
plant in Escondido since 1994. It sells its 50 or so megawatts to SDG&E, 
which transmits the power over the grid for use by its customers. 
The firm has been floating plans to double capacity at the plant just east of 
Interstate 15, but company executive Jack Wolf said a ruling by California 
regulators last week has him rethinking expansion plans. 
Adding new turbines or cogeneration plants can rub neighbors the wrong way. 
Smokestacks billow out steam, which some residents say is unsightly even if 
the plume of white is only harmless water vapors. 
Wolf said his company met several times with Escondido residents to iron out 
concerns about boosting capacity at the Iceoplex. 
"If you''re doing something like (expanding), you''ve got to meet with the 
communities, understand what their concerns are and work with them," Wolf 
said. 
Taxpayer advocates, meanwhile, do not worry whether the grid will remain 
viable over the next decade or two. Instead, they fear the government 
takeover of an aging network of poles and wires. 
"You''re going to be socializing a massive infrastructure," said Jonathan 
Coupal, director of legal affairs for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers 
Association. 
"The state of California can''t even maintain the damn roads," he said. "Now 
we''re going to be taking on not only the purchase but the ongoing maintenance 
of a huge infrastructure?" 
At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., researchers 
work to improve the efficiency of alternative energy programs and promote 
their use among mainstream consumers. 
But even as workplaces and neighborhoods across the country move toward 
supplying their own power, the transmission system will remain a vital part 
of the network that delivers electricity from place to place, experts say. 
"Will the grid be obsolete in 20 years? Absolutely not. Things don''t move 
that fast," said George Douglas of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 
"But we need to be forward-looking. 
"If each office park and subdivision has its own power source, that doesn''t 
mean you don''t want them linked, because things do fail." 
Stanford S. Penner, director of the UCSD Center for Energy Research, is 
convinced that the power grid will remain critical for decades to come. 
History has shown that implementing new technology takes far longer than 
inventing it, he said. 
"The turnover by a new technology has usually taken 40 to 50 years," he said. 
"Twenty years from now, they will still be relying on the transmission lines. 
Forty years from now, they may be starting to phase them out."

This Summer, Power-Hungry U.S. May Feel West''s Pain 
By ERIC SLATER, Times Staff Writer 
?????CHICAGO--California''s electricity meltdown has been so spectacular that, 
until recently, much of the rest of the country was sitting back, feet up, 
watching the rolling-blackout show on television.
?????No longer. As summer approaches, utility operators across the nation are 
scrambling to shore up their own systems, many of which are themselves in the 
murky middle of deregulation and in varying states of neglect and disrepair.
?????In Chicago, the recently overwhelmed power provider actually advises 
competitors on where to build power plants. In New York City, officials say 
the difference between light and dark this summer may be 11 mini-generators. 
And in states from Arkansas to North Carolina, legislators are watching 
California''s deregulation fiasco and slamming the brakes on their own plans.
?????The West is bound to suffer the most this summer, experts agree, but 
it''s going to feel long and hot across much of the rest of the country, 
whether it really is or not. And with the economy already sputtering, the 
largest power shortage since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 could be nudging 
the country toward recession.
?????"Pray for continuous clouds," advised San Francisco-based energy 
consultant Edward Kahn.
?????A good word for cheaper gasoline in the Midwest, strong backs for coal 
miners in the South and lower natural gas prices from coast to coast might be 
in order as well.
?????In the U.S., electricity flows a bit like water in that the two largest 
grids separate roughly along the Continental Divide. Power generated in the 
West stays there, for the most part, and likewise the juice in the East. 
(Texas has its own grid.)
?????With California, the world''s sixth-largest economy, continuing to 
founder after its steady diet of deregulation mistakes, the other 10 mostly 
rural states in the Western grid are likely to suffer as well. As Rep. Jay 
Inslee (D-Wash.) put it: "You can, today, see blackouts coming, big as life, 
and an energy crisis going into the fall."
?????The Eastern Interconnect, however, is larger than its Western sibling, 
more diverse in its sources and more complex in its physical structure, and 
thereby protected from some Western-style utility woes. But, from a serious 
transmission-line bottleneck near Eau Claire, Wis., to a 28-year-old Florida 
law that some say is stifling much-needed growth, the Eastern grid has its 
own kinks, soft spots and weaknesses.
?????If things start getting out of hand on this side of the Rockies, the 
first fissure is likely to appear in the last place a fissure is needed: New 
York.
?????When rates for many California customers shot up by as much as 46% last 
week, New Yorkers could commiserate. They have seen their rates rise 40% 
since 1999. A sweltering July or August could send prices up an additional 
50%, some analysts predict. As in California, New York has deregulated its 
power industry, so the market, not the state, sets the price. And as in 
California, New York is heavily dependent on natural gas to fire its 
generators--a commodity whose price has skyrocketed recently.
?????New York, again like California, also fell behind in the construction of 
new plants--the last one going up in 1995--even as demand was growing 
dramatically.
?????Now the city''s power provider, Consolidated Edison, figures it has a 
thin insulation of extra kilowatts to get it through the summer--unless it''s 
a bad one. Just in case, Con Ed wants to sprinkle the 11 mini-generators 
throughout the city. Environmentalists, concerned about the air pollutants 
the generators will kick out, have already filed suit to stop the plan.
?????Upstate New York has electricity surpluses ready to sell to the Big 
Apple. So does the nearby PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland) 
Interconnection, which serves more than 22 million customers along the 
Eastern Seaboard and has deregulated cautiously and effectively.
?????But "New York City--even assuming those generators come on line--is 
going to be nip-and-tuck," said Bill Brier, vice president of Edison Electric 
Institute, which represents private utilities. 
?????The reason: Transmission bottlenecks make it all but impossible for the 
city to import power on especially bad days. The Eastern grid is a much more 
intricate web than that in the West, a mesh of more and smaller lines 
ferrying electricity to a more evenly distributed population. But 
deregulation has fundamentally changed how the grid is used without preparing 
it for its new free-market role.
?????Constructed as a heavily regulated series of channels for efficiently 
floating power from one utility with extra power to another in need, the grid 
is now open to private electricity merchants who sell to the highest bidder. 
In 1996, 25,000 transactions took place on the grid, according to the Edison 
institute. By 1999, that figure had rocketed to 2 million.
?????"That," said Brier, "is why you''re having more and more bottlenecks in 
the system."
?????While deregulation has forced utilities to open up their transmission 
lines to competitors, it has also allowed the marketplace--rather than 
need--to dictate where new lines are strung.
?????In Minnesota, state officials would like new lines to come in from the 
west and north, bringing cheap power from the Dakotas and Canada. But 
Minnesota utilities would rather build lines in the opposite direction, 
enabling them to sell power to Chicago and Milwaukee for perhaps twice the 
price they''re getting from Minnesota customers.
?????Of course, the utilities are running into the problem that always 
accompanies proposed construction of 13-story metal towers buzzing with 
megawatts: massive public opposition. In Wisconsin, a powerful grass-roots 
group called Save Our Unique Lands calls one proposed line a "250-mile scar" 
and points out that the line would go primarily to benefit not Wisconsinites 
but their oft-derided urban neighbors, Chicagoans.
?????Just two years ago, Chicago, not California, was the daytime nightmare 
of the electrical world. A summer of blackouts large and small began in July, 
when more than 100,000 customers lost power on a 104-degree day, and 
continued on and off for weeks, with 30 blocks of the central business 
district going black for hours one Thursday afternoon.
?????Mayor Richard M. Daley went ballistic when Commonwealth Edison revealed 
it couldn''t warn of rolling blackouts because it wasn''t sure how its 
byzantine cable system works. After hundreds of millions of dollars in 
upgrades, Chicago will still be vulnerable to blackouts this summer. But the 
outages will be isolated problems of overload or mechanical breakdown, not 
the systemic failures likely in the West.
?????In Illinois, restructuring that began in 1997 has gone relatively 
smoothly, and the state and much of the Midwest has benefited from solid 
policy and a decent amount of luck.
?????Just over half of Illinois'' power comes from coal-fired plants, which 
are cranking it out at a fraction of the cost of natural gas-driven 
generators. An additional 42% comes from Illinois'' 11 nuclear power 
plants--more than any other state.
?????Only recently the ultimate utility albatross, nuclear reactors are 
gaining some favor in the Bush administration. Operated by ComEd, which is 
still working hard to burnish its image after the 1999 blackouts, every 
reactor in Illinois is not only up and running but at record output, 
according to David Helwig, ComEd vice president for operations.
?????In a brilliant public relations move, ComEd also printed maps of the 
best sites for new generators and handed them out to competitors. With less 
stringent environmental laws than in California, which hasn''t built a major 
plant in a decade, Illinois has continued to build.
?????More than 3,000 megawatts went online last year--about 10% of the 
state''s total load--and 10,000 more are planned for this year. "If we have a 
problem in the Midwest, it''s not going to be with generation, it''s going to 
be with the transmission grid," said Terry Harvill of the Illinois Commerce 
Commission.
?????When the Eau Claire-Arpin line in Wisconsin overloaded at the same time 
as a transformer in southeastern Ohio in June 1998, the Midwest became all 
but isolated from the rest of the Eastern grid. And the incident demonstrated 
dramatically another problem of deregulation that could still haunt the 
system this summer. As operators scrambled to stave off blackouts, prices on 
the spot market skyrocketed from $25 per megawatt hour to $7,500 per megawatt 
hour. 
?????Tom Overbye, an electrical and computer engineer at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote about the incident in a paper on 
deregulation''s effect on the power grid. "Imagine your consternation," he 
wrote in American Scientist, "if one day you pulled into a gas station and 
discovered the price had increased three-hundredfold, from $1.50 per gallon 
to $450 per gallon."
?????The South, with its massive coal reserves, slow population growth and, 
for the most part, a go-slow approach to deregulation, is likely to weather 
its typical summer swelter, with one possible exception: Florida.
?????With a fast-growing population and a huge predicted shortfall of 11,000 
megawatts over the next eight years, Florida had been a key target of 
merchant operators looking to build. "Everyone saw Florida as the place to 
go," said Rick Rhodes of Duke Energy, a major private supplier.
?????But when Duke prepared to build a 514-megawatt plant in New Smyrna, the 
state''s three investor-owned utilities filed suit under a nearly 3-decade-old 
law restricting the entry of power wholesalers into the state. The Florida 
Supreme Court ruled for the utilities, and Duke and other merchants planning 
to build certain types of plants have, for the time, shelved their plans.
?????When it comes to transmission, Florida has another problem. Out-of-state 
power can come from but one direction: north.
?????Supporters of deregulation are swift to point out that tinkering with a 
$218-billion industry is bound to be painful at first and that while 
California''s debacle will take years to solve, other states will learn from 
its experience.
?????As spring settles in, the Great Lakes thaw and half a dozen legislatures 
begin tinkering anew with deregulation plans, a less optimistic school of 
thought appears to be developing. "The California situation is so bad that it 
confuses people," said Harvard University energy economist William H. Hogan. 
"It scares people. It paralyzes people. . . . They learn the wrong lessons 
and do the wrong things to fix it."

State, Edison Discussed Pact to Pay Off Firm''s Huge Debt 
Proposed deal would commit customers to aiding utility even if that meant 
another rate hike. Davis spokesman says memo has been changed significantly. 
By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer 
?????SACRAMENTO--A draft agreement between the Davis administration and 
Southern California Edison would seek to return the utility to financial 
stability by committing ratepayers to help pay off its multibillion-dollar 
debt in future years even if the state''s proposed purchase of Edison''s 
transmission system falls through. ?????The proposal, which could translate 
into yet another electricity rate hike on top of the record increase approved 
last week, contains provisions that would assure investors and creditors of 
Edison''s ability to dodge bankruptcy. Yet those elements appear certain, if 
they remain in the final version, to anger some consumer advocates and 
lawmakers.
?????As negotiations continue between Edison and the administration, a 
spokesman for the governor cautioned that the draft, dated last Tuesday and 
obtained by The Times, has been updated and changed significantly.
?????Nevertheless, the 40-page memorandum of understanding lays out the most 
detailed framework yet of the administration''s attempt to avert the utility''s 
bankruptcy. Gov. Gray Davis has made a state rescue of debt-ridden Edison and 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. a key part of efforts to tame California''s energy 
crisis. Negotiations with PG&E have lagged, but officials believe a deal with 
Edison could set the stage for similar agreements with the other utilities.
?????"This draft is ancient history," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said 
Sunday of the document dated six days ago. "We have moved beyond that, and 
continue to make progress and hope to be able to make an announcement 
shortly."
?????Executives of Rosemead-based Edison could not be reached for comment.
?????There is at least one more recent draft, officials said. But the 
document from Tuesday reflects the direction of negotiations. Internal memos 
dating back weeks describe similar elements in the discussions.
?????The talks have been going on behind closed doors for almost two months. 
Even legislative leaders, including Davis'' fellow Democrats, have learned 
little about details of the talks--to their dismay.
?????"I have no idea what''s in the memorandum of understanding," Senate 
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said Sunday. "But the 
Legislature is going to hold very comprehensive public hearings, so we know 
what we''re getting into. . . . Whatever the deals are, we''re going to have 
very full and open hearings: What is it we''re getting? What is it we''re 
giving? And what is the price?"
?????The draft shows, as previously announced, that Davis is offering to buy 
Edison''s portion of the 32,000-mile-long statewide system of high-voltage 
transmission lines for $2.76 billion, or 2.3 times its listed book value. For 
the transaction to work, Davis hopes as well to buy the portions of the grid 
owned by PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric Co., for a total price of about $7 
billion.
?????The document says the state would buy the transmission grid "as is, 
where is, and with all faults" and would contract with Edison to operate its 
portion at a price to be negotiated. If the state decides to sell the grid at 
some later date, Edison, like other businesses, would have the right to bid 
to buy it back.
?????Edison would use cash from the purchase to help pay off its massive 
debt--the gap between skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices and what the 
utility was allowed to charge ratepayers. In federal filings, Edison has 
estimated that debt at $5.5 billion; barring regulatory or legislative 
relief, the utility''s parent company said in its most recent filing, it may 
take a $2.7-billion charge against earnings for the fourth quarter of 2000.
?????But the state takeover could fail for a variety of reasons; the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission could, for example, block the state effort.
?????The document gives no specifics about a backup plan for the state to 
acquire other assets if it fails in its efforts to take over the entire 
transmission system. However, the draft does contain provisions that would 
allow Edison to again become financially viable.
?????In particular, the draft agreement says consumers could be obligated to 
pay a so-called dedicated rate component to help the utility restructure its 
debt, even if the grid sale is not completed. The memorandum further states 
that the charge would not appear in rates for two years, and that the debt 
would be repaid over 12 years.
?????The charge, at an amount not specified in the draft agreement, 
presumably would be on top of electricity rate hikes approved last week that 
could be as high as 46% for some users. As such, the charge would face 
certain opposition from Republican lawmakers, who have criticized the rate 
hikes, and from some Democratic legislators, who are increasingly skeptical 
about Davis'' handling of the crisis.
?????Consumer advocate Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network explained 
the provision by saying it may simply authorize Edison to begin restructuring 
its debt, pending final approval of the highly complex transmission grid 
sale, which could take a year or more to consummate.
?????"This is a huge transaction," Florio said. "They can''t wait until the 
deal is signed, sealed and delivered."
?????But V. John White, of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Technology, among the first lobbyists to float the idea of a state takeover 
of the utilities'' transmission systems, said some terms outlined in the 
tentative agreement are causing him to rethink his position.
?????"I don''t see where the public benefits are," White said of the overall 
deal. "The price of the transmission sale is a complete capitulation to 
Edison."
?????The tentative agreement contemplates that the California Public 
Utilities Commission, which has the responsibility to regulate the state''s 
investor-owned utilities, would lose the ability to make at least some 
decisions.
?????The agreement says, for example, that Edison''s credit-worthiness and 
ability to finance improvements to its remaining holdings would require 
"greater certainty in respect of [Edison''s] ability to earn a fair return on 
invested capital."
?????Toward that end, the tentative agreement would limit the PUC''s ability 
to pare back the utility''s current 11.6% authorized rate of return on 
investment, the document says.
?????"Nothing like this has ever been done anywhere in the country," White 
said. "This would be a regulatory jailbreak."
?????Among other provisions, the memorandum says Edison would drop its 
lawsuit against the PUC seeking the right to pass on its wholesale 
electricity costs to consumers.
?????The draft is dated the same day that the PUC approved a rate hike of 
about 40% to cover the state''s costs of buying electricity from independent 
power producers. The state started buying electricity, at an average daily 
cost of more than $50 million, after Edison and PG&E fell so deeply into debt 
that they no longer were credit-worthy.
?????Executives at PG&E, the state''s largest electric utility, have agreed to 
consider parting with its portion of the transmission grid. But details 
remain to be decided. PG&E spokesman John Nelson said Sunday that talks 
between Davis and his company await the outcome of the Edison deal.
?????"It''s not because there is any breakdown," Nelson said. "It is just that 
they''ve concentrated their efforts on Edison."

Vegas Lights Undimmed 
Despite soaring prices for electricity, the big hotel-casinos don''t plan to 
reduce their dazzling wattage outside. But they are cutting energy use 
indoors. 
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
?????LAS VEGAS--The newspaper stories about California''s electricity woes can 
be read easily at night on the Strip, bathed in the brilliance of miles of 
neon and a gazillion lightbulbs.
?????And Nevada utility officials expect it to stay that way through the 
summer--when air conditioners work day and night to make the desert heat 
tolerable--avoiding the power problems that have brought California to its 
knees.
?????But that confidence is coming at a price: increased electricity rates, 
to the consternation of the Strip''s monster hotel-casinos. Between September 
and April, rates will have increased by about 46%, driven by forces that are 
pushing up energy costs nationwide.
?????The typical Strip hotel-casino uses about the same amount of electricity 
as 10,000 homes, according to utility estimates. Like anxious homeowners, 
hotel-casino operators are scouring their properties, looking for ways to 
conserve electricity and--more important perhaps to Wall Street--save money.
?????At the MGM Grand, maintenance crews are working their way through the 
5,005 rooms, changing lightbulbs to dimmer ones, reducing each room''s 
consumption to 500 watts from 750.
?????At the MGM and other hotels, incandescent bulbs are being changed for 
more efficient fluorescent lights in many cases. Thermostats are being 
installed to reduce air conditioning in unused convention rooms, and motion 
sensors are being installed to keep the lights off in empty offices.
?????Even slot machines are part of the trend: The newest models consume 
about 160 watts of electricity, 25% less than older models, said a spokesman 
for the world''s largest slots maker, International Game Technology.
?????But one thing won''t change: blazing signs and extensive use of exterior 
lighting to illuminate the resorts.
?????"Las Vegas has an image and a certain cachet it has to live up to, and 
that includes the exterior lighting and the neon and the marquees," said John 
Marz, a vice president of Mandalay Resort Group, which owns four big Strip 
casino-hotels and operates a fifth.
?????"It''s what people come here to see," he said. "And reducing those would 
be the last thing we do."
?????Even as casinos look for places to cut corners, they''re also fighting a 
bigger battle in the state capital of Carson City to reverse the state Public 
Utilities Commission''s approval of a single, whopping 25% rate hike for 
casinos, which took effect March 1. At the same time, residential rates 
increased by nearly 15%.
?????The rate increases were sought by Nevada Power Co., which serves Las 
Vegas and surrounding areas, and its sister utility in northern Nevada, 
Sierra Pacific Power Co., to pay for electricity they already have contracted 
to buy this summer. That one-time increase is in addition to rate hikes 
approved earlier that are raising rates more than 1% a month, starting last 
September and continuing until September 2003.
?????By the end of that three-year period, residential electricity rates will 
have increased about 75%, and the rates charged casinos will have increased 
by about 65%, said utility spokesman Karl Walquist. 
?????The issue is simple, Nevada Power says: Customers must pay more for 
electricity so the utility can remain solvent and buy power on the open 
market. Otherwise, Walquist said, the state''s two utilities will face the 
same dire consequences that are playing out in California. 
?????Through its own four power plants, Nevada Power generates about 2,000 
megawatts. It buys another 300 megawatts from small, private generators in 
Nevada, and another 230 from the federal hydroelectric plant at Hoover Dam.
?????Though the dam was built to create the Lake Mead reservoir, it was also 
equipped to generate 2,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power, for sale to 
agencies in California, Arizona and Nevada. However, it operates at only 
about 30% capacity, based on the amount of water released through the 
turbines for purchase by various California and Arizona agencies downstream.
?????Come summer, southern Nevada will need about 4,600 megawatts, nearly 
double its winter demand. To meet the 2,100-megawatt shortfall, Nevada Power 
has contracted for electricity generated in Utah, Arizona and Colorado.
?????The most jarring rate increase, yielding $311 million statewide in 
higher revenue to pay for those advance purchases, was approved by the 
state''s PUC in February without public hearings.
?????That decision triggered an angry response from the state attorney 
general''s consumer advocate, as well as from the gambling and mining 
industries.
?????They complained that the utilities had failed to publicly prove the need 
for more money, and that the rate increase violated agreements between the 
utilities and the PUC--with the casino industry''s blessing--calling for the 
small, measured rate increases every month.
?????A PUC hearing officer on March 23 heard testimony from the utilities and 
a consumer group on the need for rate increases, and a PUC decision is 
pending.
?????Nevada legislators and Gov. Kenny Guinn are immersed in the electricity 
issue. The state began moving toward deregulation four years ago, but 
reversed itself after watching California''s problems unfold. Deregulation is 
no longer on the state''s radar screen. 
?????Legislators also are attempting to block plans by the state''s utilities 
to sell their power plants so they can focus on transmission and 
distribution. The lawmakers fear that if the utilities lose control of power 
generators, Nevada will be even more at the mercy of private power companies.
?????In the meantime, the Strip''s lights continue to shine brightly, and 
utility officials say skeptics should not look too critically at them as 
power hogs.
?????"They''re very efficient, especially in terms of cooling as many people 
as they do," said Mike Smart, vice president of resource management for both 
Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific.

Power Crisis Batters Budget 
Stock slide, rate increases erode state''s revenue 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Monday, April 2, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N218239.DTL 
Sacramento -- Billions of dollars in electricity purchases, rate increases 
that will drain money from the economy and a crumbled stock market are 
shriveling California''s state budget. 
Even the modest estimates of revenue growth on which Gov. Gray Davis'' budget 
was based are being erased by the power crisis and the stock slide. 
"The assumption we had in January is no longer a prudent assumption," said 
Ted Gibson, chief economist at Davis'' Department of Finance. 
Although the flat economy is already pinching the state''s cash intake, the 
biggest hit will come at tax time 2002 -- 10 months into the budget Davis and 
lawmakers are trying to put together before the new fiscal year starts on 
July 1. 
Next April there won''t be the bonanza of capital gains and cashed-out stock 
options the state has reveled in over the past two years. 
Hard times in the dot-com world mean hard decisions for the Democratic 
governor and lawmakers as they put together a spending plan. 
On the Senate floor last week, President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco, warned his colleagues not to expect too much from the budget 
because the state was tapped out. 
Everything from pork barrel projects to public schools could feel the pain. 
A raft of one-time spending items are at risk: $250 million in aid to cities 
and counties, $100 million to clean up beaches, $100 million to replace 
higher-polluting diesel engines, $40 million in library improvements at state 
universities. 
The Senate has already cut $1.9 billion from the $102 billion spending plan 
sent to them by Davis. 
Davis'' January budget expected the fiscal year to end with $5.8 billion in 
reserve. Some $3.7 billion in electricity purchases have cut that reserve to 
$2.1 billion with another $1 billion in energy buys authorized just for this 
month. 
That has led the legislative analyst to recommend that lawmakers take no 
action on $2.3 billion in one-time spending proposed by the Democratic 
governor. 
"We''re being very cautious because of the number of uncertainties," said Brad 
Williams, chief economist at the legislative analyst''s office. 
There are several reasons for the worsening cash drain, which will hit 
hardest next year but is already taking a toll on revenue collections. 
One-fifth of the state''s general fund revenue comes from capital gains and 
stock options. 
That won''t be happening next April. 
In January, Davis predicted state taxes paid on capital gains and stock 
option income would be 10 percent less next year. And projections now are 
that it will be even less. 
As more companies use stock options as compensation for employees, the more 
tightly the state budget is chained to the whims of Wall Street. 
Last year, the state estimated that $84 billion in stock option income was 
generated in California. Of that, just seven high-tech companies created half 
of the income. Cisco Systems alone represented nearly 10 percent of the $84 
billion. 
Since November, the Nasdaq has lost 45.5 percent of its value, a huge hit for 
California, the center of the dot-com high-tech universe. 
For example, Cisco has fallen from roughly $55 a share to $16 a share, making 
it unlikely any holders of stock options will cash out unless they have to. 
Similar drops have occurred in other big technology companies like Sun 
Microsystems, Intel and Oracle. 
"The phase we saw the last several years will not return," said Tom Lieser 
senior economist at UCLA''s Anderson Business Forecast. "The days of the dot- 
com millionaires are over." 
"The technology sector will come back, but this year is going to be a tough 
one, and next year may be transitional," Lieser said. 
Income from investors realizing capital gains was originally expected to 
reach nearly $94 billion this year and fall to $84.5 billion next year, but 
budget analysts now say that next year''s projections may be too optimistic. 
If the stock market soars over the next eight months, the budget picture 
could brighten. 
Another budget plus could be the taxes collected this month. Stronger than 
expected revenue would stanch some of next year''s losses. 
The economy''s fade is already being felt. A slow holiday spending season last 
year has led to less-than-expected sales tax collections for the state. 
Sales tax revenue for February came in $165 million under estimates. 
And withholding taxes, which are carved out of an employee''s paycheck and 
sent to the state, are expected to continue to grow, but not nearly at the 
brisk rate as last year. 
Then there''s the energy crisis. 
The state is tearing through $50 million a day to buy power for the cash- 
poor utilities, with authorization for $4.7 billion in purchases. 
"Even Bill Gates would feel that after a while," said Lieser. 
So far, the agencies that decide California''s credit rating aren''t worried 
because Davis and lawmakers plan to make the state whole by issuing bonds in 
May or June. 
That was one reason for the Public Utilities Commission''s average 40 percent 
electricity rate increase: to create a big enough revenue stream to make 
investors more comfortable about buying the bonds. 
The rate increase is going to take $4.8 billion from businesses and 
consumers, money that might otherwise be spent in other parts of the economy. 
Although total income in California last year was nearly $1.2 trillion, $4. 8 
billion is still a chunk of change. 
"It will be a factor depressing growth somewhat over the next year," said 
Williams. 
The economic effect of the energy mess is longer-term. How much will 
blackouts hurt productivity? Will businesses expand in California or 
somewhere else with a more reliable supply of energy? 
Gibson says businesses are going to give the state 18 months to sort out its 
energy problems which Gibson thinks the state will do. 
"The silver lining is that the 2-by-4 has been applied to the donkey''s head, 
" Gibson said. "We''ve learned we have a problem with energy supply, and three 
or four years down the road this will settle out, and we may even have a 
surplus." 
Grumbles Lieser: "The thing about this is it should have been foreseen. 
People were warning us."

Davis Blames Crisis On State Republicans 
But Democratic controller points at governor 
Carla Marinucci, John Wildermuth, Chronicle Political Writers
Sunday, April 1, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

N154353.DTL 
Anaheim -- The politics of energy dominated the state Democratic convention 
yesterday, as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to embattled Gov. 
Gray Davis, who clashed bitterly with party rival, Controller Kathleen 
Connell. 
Speaking at the Anaheim convention center, where dimmed lights were a 
constant reminder of yesterday''s Stage 2 alert, Davis blamed California''s 
energy woes on former Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican lawmakers and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, which, he charged, has failed to regulate 
greedy energy firms selling power at "out of control prices." 
He insisted that he was not sure rate increases were necessary, refusing to 
say whether he would support huge hikes backed by the Public Utilities 
Commission last week. He suggested, however, that he favors a system of 
tiered electricity pricing. 
"These Republicans -- who were so enamored with deregulation just five years 
ago -- have become even more enamored with criticizing me as I try to clean 
up their mess," the governor said to tepid applause from the 1,900 delegates. 
"This deregulation disaster was authored by a Republican legislator, 
passed by a Republican Assembly, signed into law by a Republican governor and 
implemented with undue haste by a Republican PUC." 
But the governor''s Republican-bashing was overshadowed politically by an 
attack by state Controller Connell, a candidate for Los Angeles mayor -- who 
rejected what she called Davis'' "finger-pointing" and assailed his handling 
of the crisis. The dramatic development demonstrated both deepening rifts 
within California''s ruling party and the high political stakes of the energy 
crisis. 
"There will be no excuses for Democrats in this state, because we dominate 
state government," Connell said in a convention speech in which she also 
outlined proposals to require "power hogs," such as malls, to install their 
own microgenerators. 
"I spent the past eight years making sure the state had a surplus, and now 
I''m seeing it eaten away every day by energy costs. . . . Whatever solution 
(the governor) provides must come fast and be shared openly with the people 
of California," she said in a dig at Davis, who has been criticized for 
moving too cautiously and for resisting disclosure of energy contracts to the 
public. 
Warning of the costs of "a delay and an incremental approach to an indefinite 
problem," she said, "I won''t stand by and allow the consumers to pick up the 
tab." 
DAVIS DEFENDS POLICIES
Asked to respond to Connell''s critique, Davis told reporters, "I believe 
we''ve moved at warp speed to address this problem. . . . We''ve kept the light 
on most days." 
The governor, who endorsed Connell''s opponent, former Assembly Speaker 
Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor, then added, "It might be if she''s not happy 
with that, she can run for governor next time." 
Garry South, the governor''s senior political adviser, was even more caustic, 
lambasting Connell as a party infidel. "This is why Kathleen Connell doesn''t 
have a friend in all Los Angeles," he said. "She''s been picking on the 
governor since day one." 
"It''s all air," he said of her talk. "Not only hot air but a foul wind." 
In an interview while campaigning later in the day, Connell toughened her 
rhetoric, saying, "The emperor has no more clothes here in California." 
"We are well into the fifth month (of the energy crisis) and we have yet to 
find any answers from the administration," said Connell, who promised to 
release her own detailed solutions to the crisis next week. 
Unlike many Democrats at the convention, festooned with "Wilson Did It" 
signs, she rejected as "irrelevant" the suggestion by Davis that Republicans 
were to blame for California''s energy woes. 
"Californians are wearying of this finger-pointing and closed-door 
negotiations and extended debate," she told The Chronicle. "The public is no 
longer going to be patient with us. They''re going to hold the governor 
accountable when they get the bill." 
CONNELL LAGGING IN POLL
Connell, who is forced by term limits to give up her post as controller next 
year, has lagged in her campaign to become mayor of Los Angeles. With 10 days 
to the election, a recent poll showed her running fourth behind City Attorney 
James Hahn, Villaraigosa and businessman Steve Soboroff. 
Despite Davis'' words and speculation among delegates, Connell denied she was 
eyeing the governor''s seat for the future. "I''m not looking two or three 
years down the line," she said. "But I hope the governor is looking toward an 
immediate solution to this problem." 
The governor''s speech was his first since the PUC announced rate increases of 
as much as 46 percent. Davis refused to say whether he would support the 
immediate rate increase approved by the PUC but suggested that he would back 
a tiered billing system. 
"If a rate increase becomes absolutely necessary to keep our lights on and 
our economy strong, you can be sure of one thing from this governor," Davis 
said. "I''ll fight to protect those least able to pay, reward those who 
conserve the most and ''motivate'' those who are the biggest guzzlers to cut 
back." 
He later dodged reporters'' questions about specifics, repeatedly saying that 
within the next two weeks he would release a statement detailing "what, if 
any" increases were needed. 
"Many advisers from Wall Street are running numbers, and they appear to be 
different from the PUC''s," he said. 
Davis also said he has already done a lot to address the crisis and had "kick 
started" construction of new power plants and successfully promoted 
conservation programs. 
Some of Davis'' backers at the convention, watching the squabbling, expressed 
concern about some of the governor''s tactics. 
"People want a leader to lead," said Susan Leal, San Francisco''s city 
treasurer. "They''re looking for someone to come out and take command, 
regardless of who started this." 
But, she said, Davis is a tough and smart politician, and "people are still 
going to be forgiving if (the governor) does something to attack the 
problem." 
OTHER DEMOCRATS BLAME GOP
Other Democratic Party leaders were also quick to defend Davis and to blame 
Republicans. 
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, suggested 
that President Bush has ignored California''s energy problems because "he''s 
worried to death about Davis running for president." 
California is the world''s sixth-biggest economy, McAuliffe noted in an 
interview, and Bush "has basically written it off, saying, ''Good luck to you. 
You''re not getting any help.'' " 
Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Davis "is attacked 
every day by the backbench Republican yahoos in the Legislature" and 
predicted that public concern over energy would ebb by next year''s election. 
"We''re looking at issues that are going to transcend the energy issues we see 
now," Torres said, such as crime and violence in the schools, economics, the 
environment and abortion. 
But political analyst Sherry Bebich Jeffee said Connell''s criticism was 
evidence of a party split and perhaps "the opening salvo in 2002," when Davis 
is up for re-election. 
Davis''s entire party, she said, could be in trouble if voters get fed up with 
higher energy bills. 
"Do the math," said Jeffee, noting that Democrats hold all but one state 
office and control of the both houses of the Legislature. "If you''re going to 
throw the bums out, the bums in this state are mostly Democrats."

INSERT INTO `messages` VALUES(46, 2, 'Kirk Thunderwood', 'Lina Taylor', 'Re: MAE/COEX - ANEEL Resolutions', '
We have had several conference calls since last Saturday. Perhaps you should 
talk to Orlando and join us from now on. This subject is in state of flux.
As you know, those measures triggered a hostile reaction from D/Cs and from 
Gs. 
Aneel (Jose Mario and Jose Alves) called me on Saturday asking for help. We 
discussed this subject internally over the weekend.
On Monday, Joao defended ANEEL in the COEX meeting. However, we were the only 
ones. Other players were very angry. They perceived the action as pure 
intervention (despite necessary and timely for most). ANEEL was informed 
about the COEX reaction and thanked us for our position.
We examined the Resolutions in great detail. Unfortunately, it seems that 
ANEEL went far beyond its institutional responsibilities. The substance is 
OK. The format is legally weak.
Our strategy (we will try to sell to Abradee, CBIIE, COEX and ABRACEEL) is to 
remove the spotlight from the legal arguments and propose to our industry 
peers to focus on the design of a new Market agreement (to create a sense of 
buy-in). We know that the changes will be only cosmetic. The basic principles 
of the resolution should be maintained.
As per Enron''s suggestion, I spoke to ANEEL again (Jose Mario and Jose Alves) 
showing them how difficult the situation is. In our view, thard he only way 
to validate the measures is to write a new agreement (Fred and Debora are 
working on that). I was open in saying that the Resolution are weak from a 
legal standpoint. They agreed with us. Publicly they say otherwise. They said 
they are willing to negotiate. We also expressed our view to ANEEL that part 
of the reaction is parochial: some COEX members will lose their jobs. ANEEL 
agrees. That is why they are inviting all CEOs and Chairmen of the Board to a 
meeting tomorrow, where ANEEL will explain what is happening and ask for 
support from top management.
Why has ANEEL approached us? Perhaps two reasons: 1) They know we defend 
markets 2) We wrote Informativo Regulat?rio # 3, attached (which basically 
purports the replacement of COEX by a professional Board - I discussed those 
issues with Rick Shapiro before the IR was issued to understand Enron''s view 
on power pool governance)
Your comments/involvement would be very important. It is a pretty delicate 
and messy situation. 
My personal view.
1) This was a necessary evil. MAE would not function otherwise. Our merchant 
plants would be in jeopardy.
2) I would dare to say that this is a "window of opportunity" to get MAE 
working (and therefore our long term strategy)
3) However, the way ANEEL did was disastrous. They should have acted long 
before. (imposing gradual penalties). Now they suddenly "fired" 26 CEOs of 
the largest utilities in Brazil
4) We should support ANEEL. However, it has to be in a very diplomatic way. 
Orlando will take care of Abradee. Joao - COEX. S,rgio CBIEE. We have to walk 
over a fine line. If we push to hard, they will reject Enron (together with 
ANEEL''s Resolution) 
5) We should be the champions in drafting a new Market Agreement

Subject: MAE/COEX - ANEEL Resolutions
At the COEX meeting yesterday, it was clear from the lawyers presentation 
that there are grounds to legally challenge ANEEL''s resolutions. Some 
romantic guys were kind of going in that direction.
My position  was to take the subject to a Market Assembly for the 
shareholders to deliberate.
Also everybody knows, and some acknowledged,  that MAE governance was not 
working. Our line of action at the Assembly would be to support the general 
direction of the measures, and at the same time, preserve MAE autonomy, 
opening a negotiable line with ANEEL. 
The main point of discussion will be if we should discuss without going to 
court or after challenging ANEEL in court.
The Assembly was called for next Thursday, April 26th.
Fred is going to talk to Luiz Maurer for us to have a deep exam of the 
resolutions and see what points we can propose to ANEEL to improve. Also, in 
that negotiable line, we should discuss/propose some names to the new COEX.
We need to discuss this subject tomorrow.

Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time
To Maul OSU in Big 12 Opener; OU Next Foe

The Longhorns ran over, around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and
their No. 1-rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a 42-7 victory befor=
e
a sellout crowd in Austin.
The Cowboys, while they hadn''t played a good rushing team in their first
three games, had allowed only 91 net yards rushing all season and they real=
ly
do have a pretty salty front seven.
Led by sophomore Kenny Hayter''s 122 yards, the Longhorns had 205 net yards
rushing. It was the first time Texas has has 100 net rushing yards in a gam=
e
since the 58-7 thumping of Texas Tech last season.
In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the=
y
couldn''t reach the century mark in rushing, it''s no coincidence that they w=
on
just twice.
But they utilized a new gap-blocking technique  to combat the Cowboys''
stunting defense, and it worked to near perfection because Hayter, who was =
a
little used third-team tailback, turned a lot of little holes into big ones
with his hard running.
While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story, it didn''t
happen until the second half and UT had a shaky 10-7 lead at that point.
Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier
developments =01)  a huge passing play, a great defensive stand after still
another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out=
 a
potentially game-turning interception.
The huge passing play, of course, was Major Applewhite''s 96-yard pass-and-r=
un
connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into
the second half
The Horns were holding a fragile 10-7 lead at the time, they were facing a
third-and-14 and they had already had so many problems with  their punting
team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down.
After all, coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half
is the most crucial period in a tight game, and the first five minutes had
been all Oklahoma State. The Longhorns hadn''t even made a first down since
the intermission.
But they got a lot more than that. Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback
who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back
toward the middle.
When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball, the only question
was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in
college football who can catch the fleet freshman.
He did, catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the
way. That 96-yard play gave Texas a 17-7 lead and it was all downhill after
that for the Longhorns.
But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t=
he
Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and
put OSU in possession at the UT 38, and because an interception of a Chris
Simms'' pass and a long runback inside the UT 10 was negated by a personal
foul penalty against the Cowboys.
The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSU''s
only touchdown. The Cowboys were leading, 7-3, and the Longhorns, at that
point, hadn''t generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther
behind.
The disallowed interception was a possible 10-point swing because OSU might
have scored with a first-and-goal inside the UT 10. Instead, the Horns kept
the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the
scoring.

Here, briefly, is how the game went:

FIRST QUARTER
Neither team threatened early, but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon=
d
possession. They started in good field possession, but Simms threw an
interception that was run back inside the UT 10 before a personal foul
against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU 29. Tex=
as
couldn''t move and Stockton kicked a 45-yard field goal to put the Horns
ahead, 3-0, with 7:00 left. OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for 69 yards to
the UT 11 on the Cowboys'' next possession, but the UT defense held and the
Cowboys missed a chip-shot field goal try. Applewhite came in at QB for
Texas. UT led, 3-0, at the end of the quarter, but the Longhorns had only o=
ne
first down =01) on the penalty that negated the long interception return =
=01) and
just 30 yards of total offense compared to 100 for OSU.

SECOND QUARTER
The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt. With Applewhite still in at
QB, sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs, then seni=
or
TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for 18 yards. But
Applewhite was sacked and his third-down pass to freshman WR B. J. Johnson
was dropped. That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt, the
snap was high, a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked.
Stockton covered it at the UT 30, and OSU''s White scored in two plays,
galloping 21 yard to the 9, then bursting up the middle untouched for the
score to put OSU ahead, 7-3, with  9:59 left. The next UT drive also came u=
p
short, but, facing fourth and 1 at their own 40, the Horns went with a fake
punt. It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a two-yard loss. But t=
he
strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba=
ck
for the offense. On his third try, Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en=
d
zone, driving 80 yards in seven plays. Mitchell got the TD on a 3-yard run,
but the big plays were Applewhite''s passes of 15 yards to WR Montrell
Flowers, 14 yards on third-and-9 to Johnson and 36 yards to the 3 to
Williams. Stockton''s kick gave Texas a 10-7 lead with 4:23 left. OSU got
close enough to try a field goal as time expired, but Ervis Hill blocked it=
.
UT outgained OSU, 140 to 80, in the period.

THIRD QUARTER
A combination of mishaps, including a sack and a half-the-distance penalty,
left the Longhorns facing a third and 14 from their own 4. Visions of anoth=
er
punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere, but
Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double
coverage just past midfield. He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it =
on
his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a 96-yard
touchdown play. Stockton''s kick put UT ahead, 17-7, with 9:14 left. Lindsay
and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and  UT LB De''Andre Lewis
recovered for Texas at the 13. Hayter powered to the 1 to set up a
first-and-goal. He tried to go over the top, but the Cowboys stopped him,
then the Horns were penalized back to the 6 for a false start. Hayter got
three yards to the 3 off right tackle, but Applewhite''s pass on third down
was knocked down and Stockton''s 20-yard field goal gave Texas a 20-7 lead
with 6:03 left. Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for 21 yard=
s
and another TD with 2:11 left. A two-point conversion try failed, leaving U=
P
on top, 26-7, heading into the final period.

FOURTH QUARTER
With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes, the
Longhorns drove 58 yards to set up a 36-yard Stockton FG and moved 42 yards
for a touchdown, with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final 2
yards, Ivan Williams ran 21 yards for the final score with 13 seconds left.

Coach''s Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the
season against Oklahoma State, the defense did its usual fine job and the
special teams, with one notable exception, were outstanding.
"After reviewing the film, it''s clear that it was the best performance we''v=
e
had offensively," he said. "We scored 42 points and we had no turnovers. Th=
e
offensive line had its best performance."
"We were pleased with not only the offensive line, but Roy Williams made so=
me
great blocks, too, and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs."
He also said junior QB Major Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee
surgery, "played like the Major of old. He made very, very few mistakes."
The Major of old was very good. He was the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the
Year as a redshirt freshman in 1998 and the Co-Offensive Player of the Year
as a sophomore in 1999.
Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB, and Sim=
ms
started the OSU game, but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter.
Applewhite completed 15 of 28 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns.
Simms, who returned late in the game, completed 3 of 5 passes for 8 yards.
Brown said the defense "continues to swarm and play really well. Casey
Hampton is amazing and D. D. Lewis had an outstanding day. Quentin Jammer a=
nd
Rod Babers played really well. We had another blocked kick. that''s our 12th
in 30 games here. I thought it was Tyrone Jones, but it was Ervis Hill who
blocked the field goal. It''s interesting that our two best kick blockers ar=
e
both from Texas City."
The special teams played well, Brown said, except for having another punt
blocked, and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed.
"The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas," he said, "b=
ut
we have to get it fixed. We can''t keep getting punts blocked."
He said the UT-OU game was such a big game 15 or 20 years ago "that the
feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation=
al
championship." He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops "are trying to get back t=
o
that."
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State
and should be ready to play against Oklahoma. He said DT Shaun Rogers
(sprained ankle) is questionable for the OU game. "We should know more abou=
t
Shaun Tuesday," he said. LB O. J. McClintock also missed the OSU game
(bruised knee), but he should be back this week.
BLOCKING, QUARTERBACK NOTES: The big change in the UT running game was
basically one new play - a counter with an off side guard pulling and the
linemen blocking down on the play side. The QB also handed off at least par=
t
of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little
bit of misdirection. . . Major Applewhite''s knee has been one of he major (=
no
pun intended) reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in
the early games. Applewhite still isn''t 100%, but he''s getting closer every
week. In fact, he looked pretty close to 100% Saturday. That''s just in time
because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top
quarterbacks ready to go.

Baseball Recruiting Going Great

The UT  baseball coaches got a commitment last week from right-handed pitch=
er
Donald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, of Class AA state champion Weimar, giving them
pledges from two of the state''s big three pitching recruits. They also got =
a
pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen, 6-0, 175, of Forney.
Round Rock''s Joey Guajardo, another right-hander, committed several months
ago. The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey, 6-5,
230, a left-hander from Dallas Trinity Christian. He is considering Texas,
A&M and OU.
Purcey was 21-3 at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won
back-to-back state TAPPS'' championships. He also helped his team win a stat=
e
TAPPS'' title in basketball last year. He had 123 strikeouts in 75 1/3 innin=
gs
last year.
Lavinski was 14-1 last year with an outstanding 0.70 ERA. His fast ball has
been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour and he is consistently in the 90
mph range. He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up=
.
He struck out 170 batters in 95 innings last year, while issuing about 25
walks and giving up about 40 hits.
He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas A&M, Baylor, Rice, Housto=
n
and Oklahoma State.
Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher, but he also wields a potent ba=
t,
bashing opposing pitchers for a .515 batting average last season.
He  also considered Alabama, Baylor and A&M.
Lavinski, Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September 23 weekend,
along with shortstop Michael Holloman, 6-0, 165, of Dallas Jesuit.
Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford. He visited Texas earlie=
r
and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend.

Horns Rise in Polls

The Longhorns are No. 11 in this week''s Associated Press poll and No. 10 in
the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll. Oklahoma, this week''s opponent, is No. 10 =
in
the AP poll and No. 12 in the coaches poll. UT is a 3-point favorite.

Basketball Stars Visit

Kala Bowers, 6-2, of Woodward, Okla., a top national recruit in girls
basketball, took her official visit to Texas last weekend.
She is considering Texas, Colorado, Illinois and Kansas State, and says Tex=
as
and Colorado are her big two.
Heather Schreiber, a versatile 6-2 forward from Windthorst and CoCo Reed, a
5-11 forward from Jersey Village, also came to Austin last weekend. Both
committed to the Longhorns earlier.
Three top juniors also were in Austin on unofficial visits. They are  5-9
point guard Nina Norman of Jersey Village, 5-10 shooting guard Lindsay
Harding of Cypress Fairbanks and 6-1 forward Nichelle Roberts of Spring
Westfield.
Schrieber and Bowers are both rated as top 25 national recruits, and Norman
will be one of the nation''s top point guard recruits next season.
Reed and Roberts play on the same high school team and they also play on th=
e
same AAU team, along with Harding.

Subject: Re: TW''s 637 Filing  
Attached is my redline of your Sat. draft.  In addition to the revisions in 
the doc, I have a few questions and concerns:
1.  On the segmenting section, I think it is a fine legal argument, but it 
lacks something.  What is our "or else" position?  Does the Global Settlement 
give us any FERC-out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should 
be unwound if FERC screws up the segmenting issue?  I''m not suggesting that 
we should trigger a FERC out if we have one, but if we arguably do, we should 
consider threatening to use it.  I''m afraid we come across as whiny and 
FERC''s position will likely be "so what, what are you going to do about it?"  
If we have no arguable "FERC-out" and the only  "or else" we have is that 
we''ll take them to Court and force them to adhere to the original deal, I''m 
for leaving the draft as-is.  We can make our appeal threat more direct on 
rehearing if they hose us in the initial order.
2.  On the arbitrage argument, I''ve taken out any reference to an example and 
softened the verbiage a bit.  I want to leave in the references to the 
arbitrage issue, however, because FERC understands the problem and believes 
it is widespread.  We don''t need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on 
our system (although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts).
3.  Do any of the OBA changes arguably conflict with the Global Settlement?  
If so, we''d  better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting 
section.  Covering ourselves in the sanctity of that Settlement in section 1 
and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won''t play well.  It is my 
understanding that the OBA system on TW was not part of the turnback 
resolution deal so I hope this won''t be a problem.  
4.  On FN 20, I''d suggest we use Vig''s data and chart for May of 2000.  The 
arb opportunity is huge and clear.  We reference in the FN that we use all 
six of the Gas Daily price points, and I think Vig used just 3.  What''s the 
right answer?     
Good work everyone--please give it one more careful look on Monday AM and it 
should be good to go.  DF

I have tried to incorporate comments from our meeting last Thursday as well 
as written comments provided to me.  There are still some areas that we need 
to decide on.  For example, we need to determine if arbitrage argument works 
and finalize related Exhibits.  Also, re:  daily imbalance pricing at points 
that have EFM, are we keeping the 25,000 Dth??  Also, I''m not sure whether we 
confirmed that we have only called one Alert Day since 1994.  Finally, we 
need to double check the tariff language on autobalancing per note on page 29 
of draft.  Please review and provide me with comments early on Monday.

No.  Although the lack of a concrete decision is a "decision" - just not one we like.  Our goal is to get this dealt with by end of November.

I believe we are ok for now.  Do we have any indication of when the CPUC will make some decisions on the CTC methodology?

Subject:	RE: CA question
Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.
We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren''t holding some reserves for this eventuality.
Mary Lynne and I told them we weren''t reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit ("market" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called "top-down" and "bottom-up"), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped "adjusting" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.
In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA''s skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.
I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, November 6, 2000
Evergreen Solar, Inc. Issues Successful IPO; Do Alternative Fuels Increase
Stock Value?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================
Waltham, Mass.-based Evergreen Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: ESLR) issued an initial
public offering of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at the IPO price
of $14 per share. Evergreen Solar develops, manufactures and markets solar
power cells, panels and systems throughout the world. The IPO reportedly
will raise $42 million in gross proceeds to support further expansion and
development by Evergreen Solar.
ANALYSIS: Here''s yet another case of a relatively unknown company going
public based on grand marketing ideas rather than a solid track record.
Yet, surprisingly, the IPO has opened strong. Last Thursday (11/2), Evergreen
Solar''s stock closed 36 percent above its offering price, at $19.00. At
the close of the market on Friday, the stock price had dropped to $17 ?,
but still represented a strong showing while other IPOs last week (both
energy and non-energy) have crashed and burned (Excelergy, for example).

What makes the strong IPO even more startling is Evergreen Solar''s 
less-than-stellar
financial history. Since its inception in 1994, Evergreen has incurred
significant net losses ($2.5 million in 1998, $2.9 million in 1999 and
$1.9 million for the first six months of 2000). As a result of ongoing
operating losses, Evergreen has a cumulative net loss of $12.3 million
as of June 30, 2000, and has stated clearly that it "expects to incur 
substantial
losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable." In
1999, product sales only accounted for 8.2 percent of total revenue, with
the rest coming from research grants. Granted, Evergreen is still in start-up
mode with regard to a large-scale production of its business, but still
it seems very odd to see such a strong IPO from a company that is really
just getting started.
So, what gives? Doesn''t it seem logical that a company should demonstrate
financial stability before it goes public? And that if it''s not financially
stable, the stock price should go down and not up? I''ll provide one theory,
but first let''s establish exactly what Evergreen Solar is all about.
The company''s sales since 1997 have been composed primarily of solar panels.
Evergreen plans to begin large-scale manufacturing of its solar power products
in a new manufacturing facility in early 2001, a growth strategy that the
IPO proceeds obviously would support. Evergreen''s principal objective is
to become a leading producer of high-quality solar power products, primarily
for the on-grid market and the off-grid rural electrification market. What
makes the company unique, according to Evergreen, is its String Ribbon
technology, which reportedly avoids the slicing of solid block of silicon,
which is required for most solar-power technologies. Evergreen''s String
Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half, which reduces
manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability.
In December 1999, Evergreen Solar formed a five-year strategic distribution
and marketing contract with Kawasaki for the Japanese market. Essentially,
Evergreen has agreed to sell its solar power products in Japan exclusively
through Kawasaki. In fact, the partnership constitutes the bulk of Evergreen''s
business. In the first six months of 2000, sales to Kawasaki accounted
for approximately 70 percent of Evergreen''s product revenues. After the
IPO, Kawasaki will have an 8.4 percent stake in Evergreen.
The risks associated with Evergreen''s business are formidable, and the
company admits that its stock price could fall substantially if quarterly
revenue continues to be disappointing. Beyond that, Evergreen''s success
hinges on the potential growth of the solar power market, which is still
in question. Evergreen contends that distributed generation technologies
(point-of-use electric generation that either supplements or bypasses the
electric grid) will be one of the most promising areas for growth in the
global electric power market, and within DG technologies solar power has
experienced significant growth over the last 20 years. In addition, solar
power produces zero emissions, and may grow as a result of renewable energy
requirements in various states.
This may be true, but at the same time there are other competing DG 
technologies
such as fuel cells, microturbines and wind power, which may slow the grow
of solar power. Plus, there''s little proof that Evergreen''s String Ribbon
technology will produce significant cost-savings to make it a standout
technology. There are other risks as well, not the least of which is the
exclusive relationship with Kawasaki. If the relationship goes sour, this
could dramatically diminish Evergreen''s potential revenues and market share.
So, with this market profile, the question of why Evergreen had such a
strong IPO still remains. I think the answer is that Evergreen''s business
focus is exclusively placed on alternative power. At a time when e-commerce
stocks are under growing pressure to demonstrate financial success, stocks
based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular
are being received particularly well by investors. There is arguably a
general perception within the financial community that distributed generation
technologies will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market
in the next two years. Commercial and industrial customers want various
options that can reduce their dependence on the grid. With regard to 
alternative
fuels and distributed generation technologies, investors may believe that
either utilities or large end-users will begin to develop these technologies
as deregulation continues.
Remember Active Power (Nasdaq: ACPW), whose shares soared on expectations
that flywheel energy storage devices will be a leading technology. On its
opening day in August, Active Power stock increased by 210 percent, from
the opening price of $17 to $51 1/8. Although Active Power''s stock price
has bounced around since then, it still closed at $30 on Nov. 3, a very
respectable level and approximately 111 percent above its original price.
Another example is Capstone Turbine (Nasdaq: CPST), which is currently
trading at $45 3/8 after opening at $16 in June.
Along with alternative fuels, venture capitalists also appear to be responding
to technology startups that plan to provide software and related services
to energy companies. Then there is the growing market of exchanges, such
as Pantellos, Enporion, Enermetrix and the like, which could be the next
big round of successful IPOs.
The long-term question is how long such stocks can continue to open so
successfully, without having a strong financial performance to support
the opening. E-commerce stocks started opening strong about a year or two
ago, but began to take a downward decline this spring as investors demanded
to "see the money." Evergreen Solar and similar stocks may be following
a similar path, which makes time a critical factor. The bottom line is
that it is a real race for a company like Evergreen Solar to secure as
much funding as it can and grow its business while the financial climate
remains strong.

Subject: Meter # 0989814 - GMT, Inc. - 1/00 production

Stephanie,
The problem with the January payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly 
in sitara.   For January production deal 153864 shows HPLC purchasing gas 
from GMT Company Inc, not GMT Inc.  Someone needs to either correct the deal 
for 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to 
make the necessary correction.    It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292.  I 
emailed Daren on this because I see his name in sitara as the contact, but I 
am not sure who actually takes care of it.

Thu,
I''m not sure if this is your meter or not.  If it is not, could you please 
pass this email on to the correct person.
For meter # 9814, Jan. 2000 production, the volume was allocated to the wrong 
company.  The gas was allocated to GMT Company Inc., but it should have been
allocated to GMT, Inc.  For Feb. 2000 it is done correctly.
I need to recoup the money from GMT Company, so could you please let me know 
when the change has been made in the system.
Thanks for your help.

Nick, it appears that we paid GMT Company, Inc. (BA 01474) of Corpus Christi 
instead of GMT, Inc. (BA 75046) of Houston.  These companies are not 
related.  We should pay the Houston GMT for production at meter 098-9814.  
Would you please make the necessary adjustments?  Thanks.

I was looking in Unify for last month and this invoice was finalled under the 
GMT Company Inc for 15975 mmbtu at meter 0989814.  The check was sent to 
their Corpus Christi address.  The Sitara# was 153864.  The Sitara # you gave 
me is showing February as the beginning month with GMT, Inc. as the payee.  
Do you know if these are different companies?

Cindy, GMT has advised Brian that they have not yet received payment for 
production at meter 098-9814 for the period from 1/14/2000 to 1/31/2000.  
Would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible?  It 
appears that the January deal was 156292 and I believe GMT produced 15,984 
Mmbtu in January.

Although the gas is non-spec, the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough 
that it can be blended okay before reaching Beaumont.  GO FOR IT.
As a precaution, we are starting a trend and I want to be very cautious.  
Once we connect a well, we can''t go backwards.  Please be specific with GMT 
and limit him to this one well.  Otherwise he could drill more wells and flow 
them ALL through this new meter.', 'normal', '2015-9-24 2:16:23', '2015-9-25 33:16:10', 12, '0');

I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don''t want more capacity there.
Aquila''s question:
They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC''s.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs

PG&E''s question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term "power islands")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the "EPC" price and determine bid price.

Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I''ll give 
you a call to discuss further.
Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:
 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES''s and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.
PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.
Talk to you soon!!

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation
Introduction
EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.
The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron''s retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.
We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron''s core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.
In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG''s core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.
Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.
Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.
Organisation
After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.
Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.
Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.
Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.
Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.
The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.
At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.', 'normal', '2015-2-14 31:1:24', '2015-2-15 16:34:31', 12, '0');

I talked with Bob Cook, thinking that as he''s the organizer of the blood
drives, he might have a name or two of platelet donors.  The two people who
were going to donate Platelets for Michael today "bailed" for various
reasons, and my wife has tapped out her resources for platelet donors and
I''ve tapped out mine.  Bob suggested you might contact the people on the
prayer list.  What''s needed is people with type O blood (either + or -).  If
anyone is able to do so today, that''d be GREAT.  And if tomorrow or some
other day, that would be great also.
