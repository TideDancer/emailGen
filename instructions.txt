********************************************************************
you can use current generated files:
	sqlQuery.csv has all INSERT queries

otherwise you need to delete all files in output/, outputsubjects/, sqlQuery.csv, people.csv
and follow below instructions from very begining

************************************************************************


$ mysql -u xxx -p < enron.sql
will import the email database. It has around 260000 emails.

$ python peopleGen.py Facebook.csv
this will read Facebook.csv to generate people.csv which only has firstname and email address

$ python emailGen.py #number
will generate #number of emails, storing in output/ folder
Each file is named in format of index__someoneEmail, so if later need to be import to database, just remove index__ will get the sender's email

structure of the folder:
	unnecessary/   this stores general paragraphs which doesn't have actual meaning, but to fill the space. It has several parts in different files, like greetings, last sentence, etc
	necessary/     this stores actual information to generate email. Currently it has sentences to describe favorite things or work/education history
	favorite/      any files containing hobbys, favorite food, color, etc, goes to this folder. all files should list one favorite thing per line.
	works/         any files containing education, working, internship, etc, goes to this folder. all files should list one full history list per line
	output/        stores output emails
	people.csv     all sender information is randomly picked from this file, it need to be in the format of name,email
	enron.sql	this is a very big email database, which will not be in github
	outputsubjects/  store corresponding subjects of emails in output/

Around half of the email generated will come from database, but processed to eliminate receiver name or anything refering 'enron'. However, the processing is rough so still some might contain inproper information which doesn't make sense.

The other half will be generated in one of these category: 1, just greetings. 2, talking about favorites. 3, talking about working/education.

$ python createSqlQuery.py
will generate a file called sqlQuery.csv, which contains all INSERT queries
