Steve, Thanks.
I shall add to the length when DVN drops
on the news of lower nat gas prices.
Let's go out and eat (moderately)
in a few weeks.

Good Morning Vince,
 
DVN might be bought on the next  pullback.
 
Thank You again for the great dinner at Brennans. I  miss the camaraderie that we had by being in the same local. Just got back from  Pittsburgh, so I will start getting stock picks to you.
