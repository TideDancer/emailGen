Could you set aside some time today to talk to me about the recent Kennedy Oil deal in addition to 2 other deals.  These other deals were discovered in our bid week preparations, and are causing our desk some pretty big negative Prior Month Adjustments.  So, we need to get these resolved.  The first one is the Williams / wic deal. The deal #'s for that are 121890,854562, & 1068893.  The reason for the split of this deal is b/c our books changed names.  The second deal in question which needs to be resolved a.s.a.p. is a Red Rock Energy LLC deal #133661.  This deal is being booked to Denver in Sitara, but in Tagg the risk is going to Keith Holst and Mike Grigsby.  
Please look over these deals and let me know when a good time to talk will be.  Thank you!
