Please note on 10/24/01 West Power lost approximately $11.0MM (preliminary) from curve shift.
We lost curve shift mostly in NP15 ($-1.8MM) and SP15 ($-5.0MM), and also change in existing deals ($-2.3MM). Please see the attached file for curve shift by delivery point by year. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
